<h2>Guidance about conducting scientific research.</h2>
</div>

Scientists produce deliverables like publications and software artifacts.
Underlying the deliverables are many assumed research skills and principles.
This list aims to make those assumed skills and principles explicit.

For example, a research paper is a specialized format of writing.
Junior researchers, who want to write research papers, must first internalize the specification of a research paper.
Ideally, junior researchers learn these skills during doctoral studies, but in reality, doctoral study [experiences vary wildly](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/?f=flair_name%3A%22Seeking%20advice-academic%22).
Therefore, this collection provides a standardizing resource, for junior researchers and advisors, that is independent of institutional circumstances.
Most entries are drawn from computer science.

The list was initially curated on demand during many years of doctoral study.
To increase reach and collaboration potential, the list was converted to an [awesome list](https://awesome.re).
The list is related to a few other awesome lists ([scientific writing](https://github.com/writing-resources/awesome-scientific-writing) and [research tools](https://github.com/emptymalei/awesome-research#readme)), but is unique in its emphasis of guidance over technology.
There is also a [complementary collection](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/) of guides written by a single author.
In contrast, this list presents advice from multiple experts in many formats, and with emphasis on open access guides.

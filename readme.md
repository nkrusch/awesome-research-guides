<h2>Instructions about conducting scientific research.</h2>
</div>

Scientific discovery produces deliverables like publications and software artifacts.
Underlying the deliverables are many assumed research skills and implicit principles.
This list aims to make those assumed skills and principles explicit.

For example, a research paper is a specialized format of writing.
Junior researchers, who want to write research papers, must first understand the specification of a research paper.
Ideally, junior researchers learn these skills during doctoral studies, but in reality, [doctoral study experiences vary wildly](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/?f=flair_name%3A%22Seeking%20advice-academic%22).
Therefore, this collection offers a standardizing resource, for junior researchers and advisors, that is independent of institutional circumstances.
Most entries are drawn from computer science.

The list was initially curated by need, during the many years of doctoral study.
Since then, it has continued to grow with its creator.
To increase reach and collaboration potential, the list was converted to an [awesome list](https://awesome.re).
It is related to a few other awesome lists ([scientific writing](https://github.com/writing-resources/awesome-scientific-writing) and [research tools](https://github.com/emptymalei/awesome-research#readme)), but it is unique in its emphasis of guidance over technology.
There is also a [complementary collection](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/) of guides written by a single author.
In contrast, this list gathers advice from multiple experts.
Although the list is already substantial, it can always be improved by [contributing](.github/contributing.md).

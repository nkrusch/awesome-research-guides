<h2>Guidance about conducting scientific research.</h2>
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye">"Life is a game that one plays according to the rules."</a></i>
<br/><br/>
</div>

Scientists produce deliverables like publications and software artifacts.
Creating the deliverables assumes many research skills and awareness of procedural principles.
The goal of this list is to make the assumed skills and principles explicit.

For example, a research paper is a specialized form of writing.
Junior researchers, who want to write research papers, must first internalize the 'specification' of a research paper.
Ideally, junior researchers learn these skills during doctoral studies.
However, in reality, doctoral study [experiences vary wildly](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/?f=flair_name%3A%22Seeking%20advice-academic%22) in, e.g., environment and mentorship quality.
Therefore, this collection provides a standardizing public resource, for junior researchers and advisors, that is independent of immediate circumstances.
Most entries are drawn from computer science.

This list is related to other official awesome lists ([scientific writing](https://github.com/writing-resources/awesome-scientific-writing) and [research tools](https://github.com/emptymalei/awesome-research#readme)), but is unique in its emphasis of guidance over technology.
There are also several complementary web collections[^c], mostly written by a single author.
In contrast, this list presents advice from multiple experts, in rich formats, and enables collaborative refinement over time.
Most list items are open access (excluding books).

# Contributing Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

List items must meet the list-specific inclusion criteria and the general guidelines for awesome list items.
For enhancement ideas, have a look at repository issues, particularly the ones marked with `wanted` label.

## Scope and inclusion criteria

The list-specific requirements define the scope and inclusion criteria.

* The topic must be related to **research**.
* The goal is to **communicate guidance**. 
* The list item should have **long-term relevance** (several years).

List items can be in various formats: writings, slides, videos, etc.

Although academia and research are closely related, the list is <u>NOT</u> a graduate school survival guide.
  
## Awesome list requirements

All awesome lists must also meet certain ground rules.

* Only awesome items. Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything.
* The item uses consistent and correct naming; for example, Node.js (not NodeJS or node.js).
* The item has a title (with a hyperlink) and a description.
* The description is concise and informative.
* The description is in the same language as the title.
* The item link and description are separated by a dash.
* The description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.

Run the awesome list linter to check compliance with these guidelines.

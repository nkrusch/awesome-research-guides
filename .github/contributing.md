List entries must meet the list-specific inclusion criteria and the general guidelines for awesome list items.

## Scope and inclusion criteria

*Awesome Scientific Guides* is a list about research skills and principles of scientific research.
New list items should conform to the following expectations.

* The topic must be about **research**. For example, discussions of publishing, conducting experiments, research software preparation, social skills, job search, obtaining funding, etc., are in scope.
* The goal is to **communicate guidance**. There are other awesome lists for technical solutions.
* The list item should offer **long-term value**. Temporal advice, that is unlikely to remain relevant over multiple years, is too fleeting to be included.

## Guidelines for awesome list items

All awesome lists must also follow certain ground rules. 
A list item must meet the following criteria.

* Only awesome items. Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything.
* The item uses consistent and correct naming. For example, Node.js, not NodeJS or node.js.
* The item has a title (with a hyperlink) and a description.
* The description is concise and informative.
* The description is in the same language as the title.
* The item link and description are separated by a dash, e.g., `- [AVA](…) - JavaScript test runner.`
* The description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.

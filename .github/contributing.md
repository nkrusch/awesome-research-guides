# Contributing Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

List entries must meet the list-specific inclusion criteria and the general guidelines for awesome list items.
For enhancement ideas, have a look at repository issues, particularly the ones marked with `wanted` label.

## Scientific guides scope and inclusion criteria

Awesome Scientific Guides is a list about research skills and principles of scientific research.
New list items must meet the following expectations.

* The topic must be related to **research**.
* The goal is to **communicate guidance**. 
* The list item should have **long-term relevance** (several years).

List items can be in various formats: writings, slides, videos, etc.

The list is <u>NOT</u> a "grad school survival guide", and all contributions will be evaluated through this lens.
The list  has an academic flavor because universities are the usual setting in which research takes place.
For example, job search and funding are the common prerequisites for entering/establishing research environments.
However, classroom teaching is out of scope.

  
## Requirements for awesome list items

All awesome lists must also follow certain ground rules.

* Only awesome items. Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything.
* The item uses consistent and correct naming; for example, Node.js (not NodeJS or node.js).
* The item has a title (with a hyperlink) and a description.
* The description is concise and informative.
* The description is in the same language as the title.
* The item link and description are separated by a dash.
* The description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.

Run the awesome list linter to check compliance with these guidelines.

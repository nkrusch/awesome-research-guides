# Awesome Scientific Guides [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Guidance about how to conduct scientific research.

Scientific discovery is materialized in research deliverables, like publications and software artifacts.
Underlying the deliverables are implicit principles and research skills that govern the process of conducting research.
For example, a research paper is a specialized format of writing.
Young researchers, who want to participate in scientific discourse, must first master the "specification" of research papers.
Ideally, young researchers learn these principles during doctoral studies, but in reality [doctoral experiences vary wildly](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/?f=flair_name%3A%22Seeking%20advice-academic%22).
Therefore, this collection provides a standardizing resource, for young researchers and advisors, that is independent of institutional circumstances.
The list is scoped to topics in computer science.

This list was initially curated for personal use, during many years of doctoral studies, but it continues to grow with its creator.
To increase its reach and usefulness, the list has been converted to awesome style.
It is related to a few other awesome lists (namely [scientific writing](https://github.com/writing-resources/awesome-scientific-writing) and [research tools](https://github.com/emptymalei/awesome-research#readme)), but is unique in its emphasis on guidance over technologies.
There is also a complementary [web collection](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/) that covers supplementary topics.
As an added quality factor, the links in this list are checked regularly for live status.
